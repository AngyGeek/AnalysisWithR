# AnalysisWithR

ClusteringAnalysis file involves 3 parts.

The first one relates about basis analysis before clustering data. The second part analyses the optimal number of cluster with 3 different methods and proceeds to the clustering with K-Means and K-Medoids methods. Finally, the last part tests the clustering quality with the Linear Descriminant Analysis method. It is also useful to compare K-Means and K-Medoids results.

The K-Medoids clustering is coded using CLARA method which is less greedy that PAMK. 


The second file, ClusteringAnalysisLargeFile suggets a solution to cluster large files.
